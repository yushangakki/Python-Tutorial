# Starting the Python Project

## Outline
- How to setup the environment
	- **Python2** is "dead", so don't use it!
	- Conda (or pip) is a great choose
	- If the people use their personal laptop
		- Knowing how to set the path to conda/python3
	- Orderwise, they should know how to get all the packages
- What to do first?
	- Try to print (using the placeholder)
		- How to print different statements together in one line, aka without the line break. (Using end=) 
	- Start initiating some values, doing some operations and print them.
		- Exercise: how to print integer along with the string?
	- Getting the input from the user
		- Write a small robot !
			- Help you transfer units of temperature
			- Talking to you according to your response (if statement and while loop needed)
## Tools
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Cocalc](https://cocalc.com/app#projects?session=default)
	- It includes Jupyter Notebook   

## A plan to learn python
- Basic Expression
- Math Calculation, condition
- if statement
- for loop and while loop
- class
- importing packages
- interacting with the system
- writing a script
	- Exert it as a binary file 

## Further study
1. If you want to use python for automation (like creating tons of files, or organizing the files instantly, making the cursor move to the place you want)
2. Data Science
3. Software Engineering
4. Artificial Intelligence
5. Integrate with other language
